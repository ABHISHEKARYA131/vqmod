  # Be sure the vqmod folder and the vqmod/vqcache folders are writable (either 755 or 777). 
    * Also be sure index.php and admin/index.php are writable.
      * If not sure which you need, first try 755. 
      * If you get errors about permissions, then try 777.
  # Goto http://www.yoursite.com/vqmod/install 
  # You should get a success message. If not, check permissions above and try again
  # Load your store homepage and verify it works.
  # Using FTP, verify that there are new "vq" files in the "vqmod/vqcache" folder.
  # If yes, then you are ready to start downloading or creating vQmod scripts, otherwise ask for assistance.
Done!
