#summary What is new in 2.4.x

= What is new in vQmod 2.4.x =

vQmod has been changed to be used as a static class instead of an instantiated class. This was done mainly because the way vQmod works as a common tool, it will never need more than a single instance of its class, so loading it statically is just simpler.

= Static vs Instantiated =

Supposedly static is bit faster as well according to this
[http://moisadoru.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/static-call-versus-singleton-call-in-php/ article]. But mainly it was done because vQmod doesn't need to ever be instantiated so it just makes sense to load it statically.

= How do I upgrade? =

The syntax of the vQmod calls in the index.php files has changed. But your existing xml scripts will all work the same.

If you are upgrading from 2.3.2 or older, you'll need to do one of the following:
  * Use the vQmod built-in upgrade script by adding ?u to the end of the install path:
{{{
http://mysite.com/vqmod/install/?u
}}}
  * Manually change the index files based on the [Install_OpenCart] link in the wiki

If you are not upgrading or you are re-installing vQmod after upgrading OpenCart, then you can just run the normal install line without the ?u
{{{
http://mysite.com/vqmod/install/
}}}

*There is no change to the xml scripting syntax*
