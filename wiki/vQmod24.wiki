#summary What is new in 2.4.x

= What is new in vQmod 2.4.x =

vQmod has been changed to be used as a static class instead of an instantiated class. This was done mainly because the way vQmod works as a common tool, it will never need more than a single instance of its class, so loading it statically is just simpler.

= Static vs Instantiated =

Supposedly static is bit faster as well according to this
[http://moisadoru.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/static-call-versus-singleton-call-in-php/ article]. But mainly it was done because vQmod doesn't need to ever be instantiated so it just makes sense to load it statically.

= How do I upgrade? =

The syntax of the vQmod calls in the index.php files has changed. But the built-in upgrade script will automatically upgrade you if using the older syntax so all you have to do is run the usual install url after copying over the new 2.4.x files:
{{{
http://mysite.com/vqmod/install/
}}}

Alternatively, you can still follow the manual install procedures here:

*There is no change to the xml scripting syntax*
