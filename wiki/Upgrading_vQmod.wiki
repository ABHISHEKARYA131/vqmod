= Introduction =

This explains the process of upgrading vQmod to a newer version.


= How to Upgrade vQmod =

  # Download the latest version (either standalone or opencart)
  # Unzip ONLY the "_vqmod/vqmod.php_" file
  # Upload that file to the _vqmod_ folder on your site, overwriting the one you currently have installed.

That's it!

You do *NOT* need to run the vQmod installer again for upgrade
You only need to run the installer if you've upgraded your site code and overwrote the index.php and admin/index.php files
